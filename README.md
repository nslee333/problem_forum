This project is similar to [hackernews.com](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) or reddit - except that instead of tech related news, the purpose is to solve problems in tech and other sectors.

Also took a little bit of inspiration from [open-source-ideas](https://github.com/open-source-ideas/ideas).
